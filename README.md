# Software-Architecture

To be a perfect software architect, we must understand the ins and outs of software development, just as we would while performing an orchestra. The conductor, who leads the orchestra, might be compared to an architect, while the individual instrument players are developers.

Software architects are concerned with the broad picture, often concentrate on the whole application whereas developers may afford to focus on one or a few components. As a result, a software architect must have a rudimentary understanding of how various components function in order to determine if changes made in one component would impact other components as well.
